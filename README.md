AI Project 1

For this project we were assigned three
different problems. The first problem was
that we had to implement a class of shapes.
Along with this class we had to make a total
of five subclasses. These five subclasses
included triangle, rectangle, square, circle,
and polygon. For the implementation of
these classes, we had to calculate the area of
said shape.

The second problem for this assignment that
we had was that we first had to implement a
way to multiply two numpy matrices. After
that using our matrix multiplication we had
to make a method that would do the power
of the matrices, both the recursive and
non-recursive way.

Finally our last two
problems were that we had to find a
fibonacci number through matrices, and we
had to implement a recursive function.
The final problem for this assignment that
we had to complete was that we had to
implement both the DFS and the BFS search
to find a pathway through an array. We also
had to, using our DFS search, find the way
through the array that would incur the
smallest “time penalty.”
